# Anime Higher-Lower

Welcome to the Anime Higher-Lower application!
You can play this game here (Shuka's Anime Higher Lower Game)[http://shuka.rip/projects/anime-higher-lower]

## Project Description

Anime Higher-Lower is a fun and engaging game application built using the Angular Framework. The objective of the game is to guess which anime has been watched more often based on data fetched from the MyAnimeList API. The game is based on the popular browser game Higher Lower Game, but with an anime twist.

## Motivation

I created the Anime Higher-Lower application as a fun way for anime fans to test their knowledge of the most popular anime. As an avid anime fan myself, I wanted to create a game that would be both fun and challenging. Additionally, I wanted to learn and experiment with the Angular Framework and its various features while building this application.
